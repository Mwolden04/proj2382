#The "cool thing"

This is what the following cool thing is:
<ul><li>When you reach the play again scene, you are given an option to play fast mode or normal mode</li><li>normal mode is the basic book way, fast mode has the power increased 2.5 times its original power</li>
  <li>Due to the increased power, there is also bigger castles built that I named "cathedrals"</li><li>This also came with a few bugs I patched up. Personally, itfeels really satisfying to see the objects fall</li></ul>
